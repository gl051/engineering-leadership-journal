Being an effective engineer, guidelines on how to maximize your impact on the team.
* Driven by results
  * Know your purpose: you are building a product, not code.
  * Eager to understand the business problems to solve and delivering great work that is right in line with the business priorities.
  * Provide strategy, directions and then drive through them articulating a task plan.
  * Provide estimate of completion for tasks.
  * Provide clear updates on the status of a task, if a project is on track or not. 
  * Provide mitigation plans to meet deadlines.
  * Mastering your/Company tools (infrastructure and communication)
* Bias for actions
  * Know the difference between what you would like to build and what you need to build. Time is the most precious asset in a startup.
  * Do not wait for others to provide something, reach out to others to unblock the situation if you are stuck. 
  * Show bias to quicker solutions instead of perfect ones with focus on how quickly and efficiently they can deliver results. 
  * Starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. Do not get trapped in debate. If something could be done differently and more efficiently, do it and prove it with facts. 
* Leadership mindset
  * Provide positive constructive feedback, with a can-do attitude.
  * Be open to feedback and seek for diverse perspectives from others.
  * Translate business objectives to technical objectives and drive a strategy
  * Mentor other engineers and help them to get things done.
  * Build relationships for collaboration with others, be the person that everybody wants to work with.
