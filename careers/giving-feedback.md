# Giving Feedback

Feedback is important to encourage your team constructively to improve, to do something different. Everybody is different, so you will have to figure out what is the best way to give feedback to each team members. Below are few notes to guide you through how to provide feedback:

* **Start small and compounds.** Start from the small things and do not wait the small feedback to become a big one to deal with. Missing to give feedback when things occur (or relative close to it) will not bring to improvement, so the sooner you deliver it, the better it is.
* **Avoid the sandwich**. A sandwich feedback is when you start with good, then bad and then good feedback. While the intent is to softer the hard message of what to improve and work on, the reality is that the received will only remember the good part without giving too much attention about what stays in the middle of your feedback.
* **Show that you care**. Express that the feedback in the other people interest, and you care about it. For example, *I am giving this feedback because I care about your career growth ...*, or use something like *I care about you operating at high standards, so I want to discuss ...*
* **Get specific**. Share exactly what you have observed and how things can get better. If you are not specific then it will not stick. 
* **Make it a conversation**. Make giving feedback a conversation between you and the other part. The best way is engaging in a conversation about the feedback you are giving. Ask questions to foster a two ways communication, for example *This is what I have observed, what do you think about it ?*.
