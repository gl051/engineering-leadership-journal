# Question to ask during 1:1

### Guidelines:
* Use open questions, do not ask questions that bring to yes or no answer
* Listen, listen and listen what the other person is saying
* Replay what the other person told you, to make sure both of you are talking about the same topics. For example, start by saying _So you are saying that x, y, z and that you 1,2,3_



### Questions to use 
* Are you feeling challenged ?
* Do you enjoy your work ?
* What can I do to make your job more comfortable and better ? 
* 
* If we could improve in any way, how would we do it ? 
* What’s not fun about working here ?
* If you were me what would you change ? 
* What you don’t like about our processes ? 
* What you don’t like about our product ? 
* Are you happy working here ? What can I do to change how you feel ? 

### Leverage 1:1 to avoid exit interviews 

Provide questions which are aimed to understand how a person is feeling about their role, to encourage growth. You should anticipate in your 1:1 all those findings that unfortunately often came up only when a person has an exit interview. Look at what motivates a person to stay in an organization, it could be grouped in five areas:

1. Prioritization of employment development
2. Having a sense of purpose 
3. Caring about employees
4. Considering employees opinions 
5. Focusing on employees strengths 

When managers make checking in with these five questions a regular part of how they interact with their employees, it helps ensure that people feel seen and valued. And when managers help individuals on their teams feel that way, they’re more likely to be rewarded by employees who become advocates for the department and organization, no matter how long they stay.

* How would you like to grow within this organization ? With this in mind, it’s important to figure out what growth opportunities each employee needs for optimum development, whether through sponsorship, coaching, mentoring, visibility, or challenging work assignments.
* Do you feel a sense of purpose in your job? Managers can play a meaningful role in helping employees understand how their roles contribute to the organization’s broader mission. But helping employees feel a sense of purpose must go deeper than this to tap into what’s purposeful to employees about their job and connects with their own values.
* What do you need from me to do your best work ? As you explore what your employees need to do their best work, you might also ask, “What is your biggest frustration, and what action can I take to help you deal with it? What have you been trying to tell me that I’ve not been hearing? How would you like to be recognized?”
* What are we currently not doing as a company that you feel we should do ? By asking individual team members what they feel the company could be doing better, what market opportunities the organization might be overlooking, and how to leverage company resources more effectively, you’re validating that their thoughts matter.
* Do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day ? To determine whether your employees are focusing on their strengths, you might also ask, “What is the best part of your job? Which of your talents are you not using in your current role? What part of your job would you eliminate if you could?”
