Book Author: Ben Horowitz

## Book report

Tell things how they are and run your communications with transparency, which brings in: 
* Trust from the group 
* More a brain power addressing hard problems 
* Build a culture of let bad news being shared with no fear. 

### Layoffs 
If the decision is made do not wait too long. You need to execute fast, before rumors start build up. 
Have a great and transparent message of the why. If the Company is failing in performance then that is the hard truth. Be real and honest about why you are doing this, you will have to let go people who you work hard to hire, smart people. 
People need to be laid off by their manager, not the HR. The last day at the company is the day all we remember in the future. Be aware of that and how you behave. 
Address the layoffs with the people in the Company, the message is for the people who stays, the one will have to trust you and that are thinking if the same thing can happen to them. Be visible, be present and be vigilant. Be there! 

### Keep it real - do not lie to yourself 
Look at all the indicators you have and be real when you interpret them. Usually a tendency is to react immediately on positive things and instead justifying the negative ones with some sort of excuse. This only delays the pain of dealing with it, making the problem worse most of the time. For example, if your monthly user indicator are up you will immediately think about investing more in infra or people, but if you are down you probably will end up looking at it like a temporary thing because of _xyz_, instead of putting a plan to understand and fix it. Do not lie to yourself and indeed others around you. 

### At the end nobody cares 
There could be a million of reasons from external factor about you, your team or your Company failing. Stop try to analyze those circumstances because at the end nobody cares, what they care is the outcome of it. So spend zero time on what you could have done and devote all of your time on what you might do. At the end just run your team or your Company. 

### Take care of the people, the product and the profit. (In that order) 
Taking care of people means building a good working place. A good working place is a place where everybody knows about why we are at work today, they feel they know the priorities, and they know how good work looks like at the end. They also know that their good work will be recognized at the end. They are not fighting with processes, bureaucracy and politics. A good working place is a place where people sticks around when things are not going well, because that is the only thing that will stick people around. In a company that is doing great there are others things that will facilitate that such as like profits, being recognized in the market, extra spending allowed, etc ... You should focus on building a good working place first before of everything else. 

### Training people
Training people is the leadership job. You need to invest time on training your direct reports, this not only will improve their satisfaction but also will pay big return for your organization. 

Where do I start ? 

Does not have to be complicated, you can start light with one page on what you believe your directs need to know and learn about expectations, or moving to have a workshop or a book club, or a guild. 

Training on what ? 

Start with the technical skills your people care about and create opportunities for those. Also consider leveraging your most skilled engineers to teach others what they know. Second train on the vision of the product, the problem we as a company we want to solve, what is our secret weapon in our company mission. When people leave a Company most of the time the reasons fall in three categories:

* Financial - getting higher paid. 
* Bad managers - not feeling supported, listened or respected. 
* Lack of opportunity to learn news skills - getting bored in what they are doing. 

There will be always the perception that training program requires a lot of time. While this can be true there is no better investment than to improve productivity of your organization and of your Company. 

### Metrics is not all. A balance between quantity and quality 
Metrics driven by specific numbers are only a part of success, for example customer acquisition, number of sales, etc. Without a product vision you can land to a short term wins without a long term strategy. You need to take in account quality metrics as well, what is the vision of the product, what engineers think of their future in the Company, what is the customer satisfaction, etc ...

### Hiring

Hire for the journey of your Company instead of the Company that you want to build. Hiring people used to run bigger organization when instead you are building your Company can bring a lot of pain and mismatches:

* Mismatch in the rhythm. Typical mismatch in how the flow of actions happens. In big organization actions are thrown at you as incoming request. While in smaller organization or organization to build then a more proactive approach. 
* Skill set mismatch. When you are building your organization you are not having as priorities optimizing the process or the decision framework you have been using or the communications strategy. You need other skills like putting in place high quality hiring process, having terrific domain expertise, knowing how to create process from scratch. In very few words, a focus more on crating than running is a way to think about it. 

Advice on strategy for hiring leaders in your organization for a startup:
* Make sure they get the content, understand the product, the technology, the customers and the market. 
* Crate for them the conditions and expectations to create in the first month. 
* Ask them to bring a list of questions about things they hear, but they do not understand. 
* Make sure they build interactions and contacts with other people in the organization. Key people where they can learn from. Ask them to report what they have learned from them. 
* You must hire the right person for your company at this particular time. 

Managing debt you could build up when growing the Company 
* Ambiguity in role for your staff members 
* Overcompensating a key employee because she gets another offer 
* Lack of performance evaluation and feedbacks
You need to tend for the hard answer to organizational issues, to avoid to pay management debt in the future. 

How to minimize politics in your Company 
* Look for ambitions in people that are part of the company plan for success. You do no want people looking at their own success and ambition no matter what the company is trying to do.
* Avoid building up politics in the organization by providing clear processes for performance evaluation, clear organization structure with responsibilities and boundaries.

The rights kind of ambition, and managing titles and promotions 

* Nothing motivates a great employee more than a mission that’s so important that it supersedes everyone’s personal ambition.
* Every individual will get promoted to the point of where is performing not at the expectation of the next level, reaching the ceiling of his growth. 
* The crappy level principle: you will have the less performance person at the next level as the reference for people looking at a promotion at that level. This one will bring to converge all the people at that level to converge to that. This is something you don’t want. To avoid that you need to apply the karate principle: you can get a new belt level only when you beat one at that level. 
* Put in place a promotion process which is uniform across groups, which leverage a promotion committee. Educate your whole management team on the skills, achievements and expectations for each role across the board. 

Bill Campbell's framework to measure executives performance:
* Results against objectives. Set expectations and standard and measure against them. 
* Management.  Build a strong and loyal team. 
* Innovation. Achieve your short term goals with an eye on the future. You must look beyond the quarterly goal and looking with the big picture in mind. 
* Working with peers. Communicate constantly with other peers, get what you need from others. 

1:1 meetings 
* It is the direct report meeting vs the manager meeting. 
* Manager should listen for 90% of the time 
* It is the meeting where a direct report can open up to the manager to talk about ideas, frustrations, challenges, careers goals, personal situation to deal with. 

Mastering the art of giving feedback 
* Be authentic. Believe in the message you are going to say and do not manipulate it to adjust recipient feelings. 
* Make clear on what side you are, you are giving feedback because you want the other person to succeed. Make sure the other person knows that. 
* Don’t get personal. Focus on the outcome and effects of what the behavior is bringing to. 
* Make it a private moment, do not put on the spot other people in front of the group. 
* Be direct, but not mean. Watered down feedback is not going to help, it’s deceptive and confusing to the recipient. At the same time do not act as an authority, make it a dialogue and not a monologue. 

### Organization design 

Think of the organizational design as the communications architecture for your company. If you want people to communicate then the best way is to go make them report to the same manager. Organizational design is also how the company communicate with the outside world. 

* Figure what needs to be communicated, by thinking of the most important knowledge and who needs to have it. (For example product architecture)
* Figure what needs to decided on a regular basis. Feature selection, issues prioritization, architecture, etc ... how do you put all the people in proximity ? 
* Prioritize the most important communication and decision path. For example, it is more important for engineers understanding the architecture or the market ? 
* Decide who is going to run each h group. 
* You want to optimize for the people doing the work and not the managers. You need to put the right people at the top to support the people in the group and not the ambitions of the managers. 
* Identify the path that you did not optimize. Identify the path of communication you have decided to do not focus on now and pod why. Keep that in mind. You will come back to it. Do not ignore it. Build a plan to mitigate the issue coming out of it.

### Processes 
* Focus on the expected outcome. What should the process produce ? Knowing what you are trying to achieve build the process to get there. 
* Define how you can measure if you are headed in the right direction per each step. 
* Design accountability in the process, per each step. Which individual and which organization is responsible ? 

### Technique to calm your nerves
You will always go through tough moment in your career, it is part of the game in a context where you are aiming to growth yourself and/with your Company. It’s a psychological situation you have to deal with, few techniques:
* Make some friends. It is important to surround yourself with people who have been through similar situations. 
* Get it out of your head, onto a paper. The process of writing it down separated the idea from your mind and leave room for making the decision swiftly. 
* Focus on the road and not the wall. When you are driving and approaching a curve, you are asked to focus on the road and not the wall. Similarly focus on where you are going instead of what you are trying to avoid. 

### Follow the leader 
What makes people want to follow a leader:

* Ability to articulate a vision. 
* Right kind of ambition 
* Ability to achieve the vision 

A leader cares strongly about her people, before any other interests. She makes feel them part of the organization, genuinely. Her people will follow her everywhere because of the vision and the belonging in that vision she transmits. All of this shows up in her actions and follow-through. 

Everybody can greatly improve on articulating the vision, you need to work on the vision component of the leadership. Never stops improving your skills to achieve a vision, competence is key, and you need to constantly work on all three aspects of being a leader to follow. 


The role of the CEO 

* The story and the strategy. In good Companies the strategy and the story are the same thing. The output of all the strategic work is the story. 

CEO must set the context within every employee operates. This allows to provide to people in the organization specific meaning, align interests, enable decision-making and provides motivation. The story of the Company goes back to the point of the Why the Company exists. Why should I join this company. Why should I be excited to work here ? Why should I buy this product ? Why should I invest in this Company ? Why this company is leaving this world in a better place when succeeding ? 

The story is not the mission statement, does not have to be succinct. But it must be compelling. A Company without a story is a company without a strategy. A good example of a great story - https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/amzn_shareholder-letter-20072.pdf

Decision-Making 

* The CEO makes the decisions, not the product and not the sales. She makes the decisions and to do so it is required the capability to do it so with enough speed and great quality. 
* A mix of intelligence, Logic and courage is needed to make decisions.
* The most difficult decisions are the one that will be deeply unpopular with the people around the CEO.
* The CEO needs systematically gathers information and knowledge in the company’s day to day operation to have as much information as possible when the decision point arrives. An impact coming front the decisions you are going to make need to be assessed before making the call.
* Great CEO build exceptional strategy to gather the required information continuously. All their daily activities are embedded with a way to gather the right information needed. 

Making the company executing the CEO vision. 
* It requires leadership. People have a desire to follow the leader. 
* The company must have the right people in the right positions to execute well. 
* All employees can get things accomplished by having clear context, being motivated, and common knowledge is shared. People can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get things done then good things will happen for them and the Company. On the opposite you do not want to have people fighting organizational boundaries and broken processes. 
* Ensure the quality of the team you are building is key to execute with success 
* The quality of the team is related to the challenges Company is facing at this moment. You may expect teams changing to align on the qualities while challenges are evolving during the time. 
* Set realistic expectations for your Company, not too high and not too low. You can’t refer to other Company, the best bet is to look at the vision of the CEO and the quality of the execution you have in front of you. Focus on key indicator about how your organization is running

Accountability vs. Creativity 
* Solving hard problems needs to take in consideration the risk of the problem we are trying to solve. You need creativity and that point and accountability is needed, but you will have to factor in the risks we are taking. Anyone should be accountable for solving easy problem. Hard problems you need to budget in the risk to judge on accountability (i.e. a missing deadline to ship) 
* Assumption is that you have a pool of people you work with which are creative, intelligent and motivated. If you do not have that you can give up on creativity and innovation and address the root problem of your team. 
* Address accountability across three dimensions: promises, results and efforts. 
* Efforts: world-class company requires world-class efforts. This is simple as that and you need to align on this. 
* Promises: holding people for what they have committed. How strong you hold someone accountable for commitments decrease with an increase in the risk and complexity of the things they are working to achieve. In this case looks at the results of the efforts. 
* Results: if someone missed delivering results you need to look at the seniority of the employee and the degree of difficulties. You should expect the senior people being able to forecast more accurately their results. When you are looking at the consequence of missing a result you then need to take on account the difficulty. Some problems are hard to solve. 
* Do not take stupid risks. There are no rewards without taking risks, but there are risks with no rewards. You want to avoid the latter one. Ask yourself if we did take the right risk. What happened otherwise if we did it take that change ? 

 Building world-class organizations 
* You must hold your people for a high standard. Keep in mind also that your standards will evolve from the time you hired someone to the time you are facing now. It is part of the nature of the business having standards evolving 
* You must get leveraged. After the integration time of the person, then you should find yourselves released and relief about functions you were executing before. 
* There are a lot of smart people you can hire, but smart is not good enough. You need people who are great where greatness is needed. 
* You need people who love the job they are hired for and who loves the mission.
