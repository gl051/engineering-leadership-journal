Other random notes:

* One alone study.
* You need to find people not scared to take risk and available to pay attention to what you are thinking
* You need to bring on your side not all the “people power” but just a group. The way to reach people makes the difference, you should study your audience.
* People scared of changes are tough to bring on your side
* A plan as result of curiosity and research open mind. Look also for far/odd examples.
* Only a good team can lead the big change, drawing other people's attention, give the guideline to follow.
* You will always have people against you, it's natural to have at least one that is going to do all what he can to demonstrate that you are wrong.
* Give visibility about the organization's plan to everybody, give value to every potential player in the change, assign motivations.
