# Breaking silos across teams

Bringing together diverse perspectives is essential to build great products. Not only you will need to make sure that each team member feels safe to express their point of view, but also you will need to break silos across teams. This is not easy sometimes, but it is possible and needed to foster that collaboration which is a requisite to build great products. Consider the following factors to craft the art of breaking silos:

1. Build Trust

Provide an environment where people are comfortable talking and sharing ideas, an environment where failures are celebrated as learning experiences. Have open and blameless discussions, with the purpose of learning from other experiences in mind.

2. Communicate with intention

Be authentic when communicating to the teams, shared openly goals and vision. Align people on the values of getting together such as: 
* Why are we here ? 
* What are the important aspects of our collaboration ? 
* How do we want to collaborate ? 

3. Story telling

Everybody in the team should be able to explain to any stakeholder what the team is working on. A level of abstraction is needed to unify on the language and the message. Goal is to be able to express the same message to any other individual, independently form their role and the subject where they are experts. 

4. It takes time and resilience to get it right 

Getting teams aligned and effectively collaborating is hard, and it takes time. It is an evolutionary approach where you will have to iterate to smooth corner at every round. You will have to try, measure and judge standards and processes to operate across teams, until you find what it works in the current context you are. You know you are on the right path when you start seeing people feeling comfortable to challenge each other and learn from that. Likewise, you will see a unanimous trust growing around the product you are building.
