# Scaling Teams

Scaling teams is a challenge that comes when your Company is growing, it requires a lot of soft skills in order to be able to do it successfully. The following are notes about how to scale efficiently your team in a growing environment.

## Adaptable and Agile Teams

Adaptability and agility comes together as an essential mix of requisites to scale teams with success. The following are strategies to help to achieve that:

* Restructure your team intentionally. Every team and organization will change whether we want it or not. We need to be aware of what are the needs of a team and support the changes to fulfill those needs. Awareness will bring to a more powerful structure of your team.

* Hire first for soft skills. Soft skills are harder to learn that technical skills. 

* Adjust to new technologies when it makes sense, instead of exploring without having in mind the impact you want to have on a specific challenge to address. Contextualization and collateral impacts needs to be considered.

* Set goals to produce outcomes and not outputs. Provide the team the flexibility and the space to think creatively about the problem to solve and focus on the outcome instead of the output. The output manifests are the team creativity to produce the outcome you have set expectation with them.  


## Hiring 

* Hire for Quality. Keep the bar high and hire for quality, it can be hard to find the right person, and it can take time, but you need to hire slow. If you are not getting the right candidates do a retrospective of where the challenge is. Do you have sourcing problem ? Do you have a vague picture of what you are looking for and the skills you require important to have ? Is your budget competitive on the market ? Define at what stage the pipeline fails and address the route cause. 

* Hiring Competition. The most important factors for a candidate are the hiring manager, the team and the work. Present those topics in a very convincing way, be authentic and honest while presenting a compelling narrative. 

* Integrate the new hire. Have a solid onboard plan to allow the candidate to ramp up technically and socially withing the team. Provide an on-boarding buddy and office hours to facilitate the integration. Allow time for training.
