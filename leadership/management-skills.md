# Management Skills 

* __Operations__: Effective leaders are careful to get their “meeting operations” in excellent order. This means they master the type, frequency and content of their most important meetings. At “leading a team” stage, the most important meetings include: 1:1s, team meetings, and offsite.

* __Practices__: Leaders must know how to execute on key practices such as performance reviews, compensation setting, goal management, leaves of absence, role transfers, promotions, hiring, terminations, and career development. The approach to each practice will vary from company to company.

* __Performance__: The leader should have a vision and strategy for team performance. Regardless of approach, the leader must understand each individual’s strengths and weaknesses, coach for high performance, and manage under-performance.

* __Structure__: Optimize the structure of each role. Instead of taking this for granted, leaders can be proactive and strategic in how they structure the work for each individual and role.

* __Risk__: It is important to have rudimentary knowledge of legal, financial, and reputational risks. An understanding employment law, especially discrimination and harassment, can be very helpful. The general idea is to develop strong judgement about when to escalate issues to upper management, legal, etc.
