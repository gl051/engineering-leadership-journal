# Managing when everything goes on fire ? 

When everything is on fire, it is tempting for managers to jump in and take personal action. Do not do it! You are getting a request for your team to take care of an important bug, you have one of your engineers assigned to it to start immediately working on a resolution, while the rest of team keep working on the projects in plan for the quarter. Your team is running thin and all of a sudden you are getting another request to look at an urgent issue. You feel you do not want to disrupt your team, and you have enough IC skills to take care of it. Here is the problem doing so, you are not focusing your time and energy on the most important thing: figuring it out where all these fires are coming in and putting in place a plan to stop them to come. The following ones are some advice on how to respond to an incident as a manager:

* Look after your people. Firefighting is stressful and can bring to burnout. There is only one person who is responsible for taking care of the people in the team, and this person is you. Reach out and making them feel you are there to support based on what they need. 

* Assess the problem. Why there are so many fire drills ? How can you stop them ? It should be your priority to find something that can be done to stop them, looking at people, processes, technical situations, etc ... Is there any commitment that you should revisit to support the plan to reduce the probability of those fires to happen ? 

* Ask many questions to understand what is happening. 
  * Why does the team have more work than we can manage ? 
  * Has something changed creating a greater workload than before ? 
  * What are the steps we can take to make the workload more manageable ? 
  * Is there any metric we can look at to understand if there are specific areas where fires manifest the most ? 

* Look at the opportunity to train new people on a specific domain. While it could be tempting to have the most senior person / or the SME taking care of the fire quickly, there are going to be times when you could benefit to train a new person by pairing him to the person looking at the issue, or creating a postmortem discussion on what has been done.
